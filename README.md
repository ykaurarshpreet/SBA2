I faced some acessbility challenges since I was having a hard time applying the grid and making sure everything ran smooth in the mobile version. I am still tweaking my project so it can become fully accessible on the mobile version. I made sure my design was responsive and accessbile by checking my live server everytime I made any adjustments to my Index and CSS file. I also checked the inspect section and used lighthouse to check for accesbility issues. I am still working through some kinks. I found some youtube videos about grids and flexboxes useful as well as W3 website and team collaboration on Discord.
